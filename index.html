  <h1>Bayesian Conditional Cointegration</h1>
  <p>Due to popular demand, this website has been created to share code for the paper <a href="http://icml.cc/2012/papers/570.pdf"><em>Bayesian Conditional Cointegration</em></a> presented at <a href="http://icml.cc/2012/"><em>ICML 2012</em></a>.</p>
  <p>So far, I have created an iPython notebook which you can view with 
    <a href="https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/bayesiancointegration/python/blob/master/A%20Bayesian%20Test%20For%20Cointegration-ROC.ipynb">nbviewer</a>
    or even run with
    <a href="http://mybinder.org:/repo/bayesiancointegration/python">mybinder</a>
  </p>
  <p>If there is interest, I will try to find the time to release versions of my code in MATLAB, R, or even C. If you are interested, please get in touch.</p>
  <p>I hope this code proves useful.</p>
  <p>Chris Bracegirdle, April 2017.
